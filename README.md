Small fast written Bot, that started once, searches new Items (reminds last read one) and sends them to one channel.

Uses the following perl libraries:

   * Net::Twitter
   * Bot::BasicBot


  Very simple Twitter-IRC Bot which posts search results to IRC channel 
     Goes offline when it doesnt find anything new after a while.
     It saves the last posted tweed id, so it resume the search.

   Sorry for that unproper code and dirty style.. it was more like a prove of concept .. which runs :D
